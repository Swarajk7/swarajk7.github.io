I am a graduate student in data science and currently in 1st year of masters program. I graduated from National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India in 2015 with an honor in Computer Science and Engineering. After graduation, I worked with Microsoft for 2 years in enterprise business team and contributed to the large-scale backend system which dealt with high volume business sensitive data. While working, I came across various applications of machine learning and it really grabbed my interest. The interlace between math and computer science is something really amazing and the way it is driving every business is completely wonderful.


With a motivation to learn and contribute to the era of Machine Learning, I am currently focusing towards advancement of Deep Learning in Health Care and Natural Language Processing domain. I have theoretical and empirical understanding of various state of the art deep learning models for Vision and NLP, which has helped me to replicate many deep learning papers for cross domain research.


This blog is a knowledge repository, which is complied with various problems and interesting solutions that I have come across and found interesting.
